# Langchain_RAG_Project
LangChain RAG Project 🔍🤖 This project demonstrates the implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using LangChain, a cutting-edge framework for building AI applications with large language models (LLMs). 🚀

**#About the Project:**
RAG enhances LLM capabilities by:

Retrieving relevant information from external sources.
Generating accurate and context-aware responses based on the retrieved data.
This project serves as a hands-on example of combining retrieval mechanisms with generative AI to create smarter, more reliable applications.
